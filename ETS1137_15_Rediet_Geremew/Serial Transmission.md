problem analysis
1.Input: Obtain the size of the file in bytes.
2.Calculate the number of characters: Since a byte consists of 8 bits, calculate the total number of characters in the file.numCharacters = fileSize * 8.
3.Calculate the time taken for transmission: Divide the total number of characters by the transmission rate to find the time taken.timeTaken = numCharacters / transmissionRate.
4.Convert time units: If necessary, convert the time taken into more appropriate units (hours, minutes, seconds) for better understanding.
5.Output: Display the time taken to transmit the file.
Algorithm:
1.Start
2.Declare variables: fileSize (in bytes), transmissionRate (in characters per second), timeTaken (in seconds).
3.Input the fileSize in bytes.
4.Calculate the number of characters in the file:numCharacters = fileSize * 8 (assuming each byte consists of 8 bits).
5.Calculate the time taken for transmission:timeTaken = numCharacters / transmissionRate.
6.Convert the time taken to appropriate units (hours, minutes, and seconds).
7.Display the time taken for transmission.
8.End
