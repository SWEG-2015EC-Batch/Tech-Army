Problem analysis
1.Input: Obtain the capacity of the automobile's fuel tank in gallons and its miles per gallon (MPG).
2.Calculation: Multiply the fuel tank capacity by the miles per gallon to compute the total distance the automobile can travel without refueling.
3.Output: Display the computed distance to the user as the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.
Algorithm
1.Start
2.Declare variables fuelTankCapacity, milesPerGallon, and milesPossible as floats.
3.Input the fuelTankCapacity in gallons from the user.
4.Input the milesPerGallon from the user. 
5.Calculate milesPossible using the formula: milesPossible = fuelTankCapacity * milesPerGallon.
6.Display milesPossible as the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.
7.End
