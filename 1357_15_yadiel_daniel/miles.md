Algorithm
1.Start
2.Declare variables fuelTankCapacity, milesPerGallon, and milesPossible as floats.
3.Input the fuelTankCapacity in gallons from the user.
4.Input the milesPerGallon from the user.
5.Calculate milesPossible using the formula: milesPossible = fuelTankCapacity * milesPerGallon.
6.Display milesPossible as the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.
7.End
