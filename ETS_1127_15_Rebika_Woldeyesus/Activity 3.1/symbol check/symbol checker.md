Step 1: Start the program

Step 2: Declare a variable called 'unknown' of type char

Step 3: Print "Enter any character:"

Step 4: Read input from the user and assign it to the variable 'unknown'

Step 5: If 'unknown' is an alphabet character, then:
    - Check if 'unknown' is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U)
        - If it is a vowel, then print "You entered a vowel letter"
        - If it is not a vowel, then print "You entered a consonant letter"
    - Check if 'unknown' is an uppercase alphabet character
        - If it is uppercase, then print "You entered an alphabet in uppercase"
        - If it is lowercase, then print "You entered an alphabet in lowercase"

Step 6: If 'unknown' is a digit, then:
    - Print "You entered a digit"
    - Check if 'unknown' is an even number
        - If it is even, then print "You entered an even number"
        - If it is odd, then print "You entered an odd number"

Step 7: If 'unknown' is neither an alphabet character nor a digit, then:
    - Print "You entered a special character"

Step 8: End the program
