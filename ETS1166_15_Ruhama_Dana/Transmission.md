#6. Operation
1 character is represented by 1 byte in the ASCII method 
Time conversion(time in seconds): 
time it takes for the 400mb file to be completely transmitted=419,430,400 byte*sec/ 960byte 
Time in day conversion= time in seconds/86,400
Output 
Time in seconds
Time in day
Pseudocode
1. Start the program.
2. Declare variables: time_in_seconds as a float, time_in_days as a float.
3. Calculate time_in_seconds by dividing 419430400 by 960.
4. Display a message showing the value of time_in_seconds as the time it takes for the complete transmission of the 400mb file in seconds.
5. Calculate time_in_days by dividing time_in_seconds by 86400.
6. Display a message showing the value of time_in_days as the time it takes for the complete transmission of the 400mb file in days.
7. End the program.
